    "# What is pandas?\n",
    "Now we begin to see one of the reasons why Python is so popular: **libraries**. Libraries are self-contained packages of coded capabilities that can be imported into Python to extend its functionality. One of the most fundamental libraries for working with data is called _pandas_.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.\"  http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n",
    "    \n",
    "The main way pandas does this is through the implementation of two data structures: Series and DataFrame. We will learn more about them soon but for now let's load some data and see some of the things we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use a library?\n",
    "Have you ever seen a data file where the first row contains column headers? Of course you have! That is way more common than just having rows of data. By using the correct _parser_ in pandas, we can automatically read the headers. Of course, we can program that ourselves in base Python, but why would we want to? Someone else already did a good job of doing it so let's use their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "That same idea applies to many other computing tasks, too. If the functionality is already available in a library we can put it to work instead of having to write the code ourslves."

    "In the previous chapter, we dove into detail on NumPy and its ``ndarray`` object, which provides efficient storage and manipulation of dense typed arrays in Python.\n",
    "Here we'll build on this knowledge by looking in detail at the data structures provided by the Pandas library.\n",
    "Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a ``DataFrame``.\n",
    "``DataFrames`` are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data.\n",
    "As well as offering a convenient storage interface for labeled data, Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, NumPy's ``ndarray`` data structure provides essential features for the type of clean, well-organized data typically seen in numerical computing tasks.\n",
    "While it serves this purpose very well, its limitations become clear when we need more flexibility (e.g., attaching labels to data, working with missing data, etc.) and when attempting operations that do not map well to element-wise broadcasting (e.g., groupings, pivots, etc.), each of which is an important piece of analyzing the less structured data available in many forms in the world around us.\n",
    "Pandas, and in particular its ``Series`` and ``DataFrame`` objects, builds on the NumPy array structure and provides efficient access to these sorts of \"data munging\" tasks that occupy much of a data scientist's time.\n",
