If you are using a single module (as in this example), you should use __name__ because depending on if it’s started as application or imported as module the name will be different ('__main__' versus the actual import name). This is needed so that Flask knows where to look for templates, static files, and so on. For more information have a look at the Flask documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the route() decorator to tell Flask what URL should trigger our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is given a name which is also used to generate URLs for that particular function, and returns the message we want to display in the user’s browser.\n",
    "\n",
